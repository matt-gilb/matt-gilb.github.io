# Overview

We joined our local dive shop—[Diventures](https://www.diventures.com/locations/atlanta/)—for a bus trip to Key Largo, in the Florida Keys for a weekend of diving with [Rainbow Reef](https://rainbowreef.com) dive center.

We started the trip by meeting up at Diventures to board their custom bus on Friday evening. The bus was designed for longer road trips and has tables and sleeping bunks. We drove overnight down to Key Largo, and arrived about 12 hours later in the early morning on Saturday. Diving began that morning around 8:00 AM.
