## Here's why I keep my own blog

Andy Baio over on the waxy blog wrote a great article about why its important to keep a blog in 2016. Here's a quote from one of my favorite parts, but do give the post a read — it's worth it.

> Here, I control my words. Nobody can shut this site down, run annoying ads on it, or sell it to a phone company. Nobody can tell me what I can or can’t say, and I have complete control over the way it’s displayed. Nobody except me can change the URL structure, breaking 14 years of links to content on the web.

This is exactly why I have my own blog instead of just posting on some other social service.
