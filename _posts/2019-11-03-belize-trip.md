# My two week visit to Belize

In November of 2019 I finally made it to Belize, a counrty I've wanted to visit for several years. I decided to make the most of my time in the country, and see as much as I could. I broke the trip up into two parts: the first week would be scuba certification and some fun dives, and the second week would be exploring the country by motorcycle.

## Where I went

For the diving I stayed at Victoria House Resort in the town of San Pedro, located on Ambergris Caye. For the motorcycle touring, I started in Hopkins where I rented the motorcycle, then west, across Belize to San Ignacio, back to Hopkins, then south to Placencia, and back to Hopkins.

### San Pedro, Ambergris Caye

To start my adventure, I spent a week at [Victoria House Resort](https://www.victoria-house.com){:target="_blank"} and explored the town of San Pedro. I had completed my scuba diving training online before my trip, and I did my checkout dives with [Belize Diving Adventures](https://www.belizedivingadventures.net){:target="_blank"}.

### Hopkins

I rented the motorcycle for the second half of my trip from Emma at [Alternate Adventures](https://www.alternateadventures.com) in Hopkins. It was a capable 250cc dual-sport bike that could get me everywhere I wanted to go.

### San Ignacio

I spent three days in San Ignacio to see the ancient Myan Cities in the western region of Belize. I wanted to see both [Xunantunich](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xunantunich+Mayan+Ruins/@17.0915667,-89.1087294,12.96z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8f5e432fdaecf159:0xc25e11f3e5510e63!8m2!3d17.0898859!4d-89.1422331!16zL20vMDE0azd0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQzMC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D){:target="_blank"} and [Caracol](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caracol+Natural+Monument+Reservation/@16.7636211,-89.1176817,15.62z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8f5e3d0bf918a3a9:0x9cc8d6c1d3d99607!8m2!3d16.7630815!4d-89.1178134!16zL20vMDE3cF9s?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQzMC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D){:target="_blank"}, but Caracol prooved to be too remote and the dirt road getting there had been washed out in a storm a few days earlier. Xunantunich was amazing though, and I ended up spending the better part of a day exploring every nook and cranny of the grounds and surrounding forrest.

### Placencia

I had a very short overnight stay at a fun little beach cabana in Placencia. I didn't get to do much, but I did explore the town and beaches for a few hours.

### Back to Hopkins

After spending the night in Placencia, I returned to Hopkins and went to see the [Cockscomb Basin Nature and Jaguar Reserve](https://www.google.com/maps/@16.7839404,-88.4612138,15.38z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQzMC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D){:target="_blank"} where I walked a few of the tended trails through the jungle near the main park.
