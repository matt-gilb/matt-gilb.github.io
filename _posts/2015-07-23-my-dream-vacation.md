## Oh to live that tropical life

I have a dream to move permanently to Belize some day. But, while that may not happen until I retire, in the near term, I am planning on making my next long vacation a trip to Belize. I plan on seeing everything from the barrier reef to the jungle mountains.

Meanwhile, enjoy this promo video which highlights what makes Belize so awesome.
