# Dive Trip Report: Cozumel part 2

We went back to Cozumel for a few days of diving, followed by a week exploring the island and staying at Ventanas el Mar hotel over on the East side of the island. We enjoyed the beautiful beaches, delicious food, and the warm tropical climate. The hotel was conveniently located on the carribean side of the island, situated far from the main tourist areas. We also took advantage of the island's many attractions, including hiking, and visiting the famous Mayan ruins. Overall, it was a great trip and we can't wait to go back again soon!

# Video short of our dives

I used iMovie's "magic movie" feature on my iPhone to create this video. I hadn't used this before, so I wanted to give it a shot. Overall it was very easy to use, and the results weren't bad for how quickly it got everything together.
