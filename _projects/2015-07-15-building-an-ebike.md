## How I built an electric bicycle from scratch

Building your own eBike is no easy undertaking. But in 2015, if you want to have a good eBike and not spend a small fortune, then you really need to build your own.

### Updates for 2017

After struggling with the reliability of the motor on the bull and the battery beginning to lose capacity, I decided to replace the original parts with a motor & battery kit. Thankfully, eBike kits have come a long way since I first built this bike, and there are a lot of great options to work with. In this case, I updated (and upgraded) to a Bafang BBS-HD motor/controller kit and pre-built battery. The kit came from (Luna Cycle)[https://lunacycle.com/bafang-bbshd-1000w-middrive-kit/] and had everything needed to bolt on to the bike.

**The 2017 Changes**

Here are some pics of the bike with the Bafang BBS-HD and battery from Luna Cycle.

### Original story

Before I get started, let me share a little about my history and motivation in building an ebike: I used to ride motorcycles exclusively, but living in a big city meant most of my riding was in traffic, with all the risks and downsides that entails. I ended up replacing my motorcycle with a car, but I missed not having two wheels under me. I also despised getting stuck in rush-hour traffic ten times a week. On top of that, I felt I needed to get some more exercise in my daily routine. I knew a bicycle would get me out of traffic, but I didn't think I was fit enough to ride to work every day. So after searching around, I discovered the world of eBikes—which is short for electric bicycle—and knew I wanted one. The trouble was, these were super new, and almost no company was offering one for sale. It was a hobby-group/home-grown sort of a niche. Luckily, I was already handy with both mechanics, and electronics, so I had the basic skills needed to build my own. This is the story of how I did that.

The bike I chose is a Motobecane Fantom Trail dual-suspension mountain bike, which I picked up at a discount on (Bikes Direct)[https://www.bikesdirect.com]. I figured with the power I wanted to use, I would be smart to have full suspension and disk brakes.
