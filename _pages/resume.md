# Work Experience

With over a decade of experience in email delivery, I possess a deep understanding of deliverability and industry knowledge. My email-centric career began in 2014, where I provided technical support to developer-users of Mandrill's transactional mail service. Over time, I progressed to a senior software engineer position on Intuit Mailchimp's Delivery team. In this role, I specialize in delivery-specific data engineering and analytics. I work on the team responsible for managing the sending infrastructure for Mailchimp and Mandrill, processing over one billion emails daily on average. Additionally, I collaborate on large data-driven projects that have a significant impact on the company as a whole. My extensive experience has honed my troubleshooting intuition and ability to swiftly resolve technical and non-technical challenges.
