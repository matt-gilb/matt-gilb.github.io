# Work Experience

I’m an engineer with over 10 years of experience in email delivery with deep deliverability and industry knowledge. I got my start in email providing technical support to developer-users of Mandrill’s transactional mail service, and have worked my way up to a senior software engineer on Intuit Mailchimp’s Delivery team, where I specialize in delivery-specific data engineering and analytics. I work on the team who manages the sending infrastructure for Mailchimp and Mandrill, sending over one billion emails per day on average, while working on large data-driven projects that impact the company as a whole. With this experience comes a strong troubleshooting intuition and ability to effectively solve problems quickly through both technical and non-technical means.
